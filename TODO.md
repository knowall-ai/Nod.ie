## üêõ Known Bugs to Fix

1. **Audio not playing** - Main issue preventing voice responses from Unmute
2. **Circle alignment jumps** - Circle moves position after unmuting (CSS transition issue)
   - Need to ensure position remains fixed during state changes
   - May need to separate visual states from layout properties
3. **Drag functionality** - NOT WORKING
   - CSS `-webkit-app-region` conflicts with click events
   - Need to implement manual mouse event handling
   - Add visual feedback when drag is ready
4. **Memory leaks** - Long-running sessions may accumulate audio buffers
5. **WebSocket errors** - Better error handling needed
6. **Developer Tools window** - Too small when attached, needs detached mode by default

## üìù Notes

- Priority should be fixing audio output - without this, Nod.ie can't fulfill its primary purpose
- Consider using Unmute's frontend code as reference for audio handling
- May need to collaborate with Kyutai team for better documentation
- Test with different audio devices (USB, HDMI, Bluetooth)
