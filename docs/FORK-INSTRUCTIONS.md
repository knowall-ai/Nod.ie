# Instructions for Forking and Customizing Unmute

## Quick Steps:

1. **Fork on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/kyutai-labs/unmute
   - Click "Fork" â†’ Select "KnowAll-AI" as owner
   - This will create https://github.com/KnowAll-AI/unmute

2. **Clone and Modify:**
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/raid1/GitHub
   git clone https://github.com/KnowAll-AI/unmute.git
   cd unmute
   ```

3. **Edit System Prompt:**
   Open `/unmute/llm/system_prompt.py` and find the section that defines the identity:
   
   Replace lines containing:
   - "This website is unmute dot SH"
   - References to unmute.sh
   
   With:
   ```python
   # Identity section
   identity = (
       "You are an AI voice assistant running on a customized fork of Kyutai Unmute. "
       "You're running locally on someone's personal computer as a desktop assistant application. "
       "There are 3 independent systems: STT for speech-to-text (your ears), "
       f"the LLM which is {model} (your brain), and TTS for text-to-speech (your mouth). "
       "The core voice technology (TTS and STT) is by Kyutai Labs, running through a fork maintained by KnowAll AI."
   )
   
   # Environmental awareness
   environmental = (
       "\n\nEnvironmental awareness: "
       "You are operating in a real-world environment where you'll hear background noise and conversations. "
       "Many things you hear may not be directed at you - that's perfectly normal. "
       "If you hear conversations that seem unrelated or not directed at you, simply ignore them. "
       "Silence is natural and expected - do not fill quiet moments with unnecessary speech. "
       "Only respond when you're reasonably confident someone is addressing you directly. "
       "If someone hasn't spoken for a while, that's fine - just wait patiently. "
       "Never ask 'are you still there?' or similar questions about the user's presence."
   )
   ```

4. **Update Docker Setup:**
   The Unmute backend is already running. To use your fork:
   ```bash
   # Stop current Unmute
   docker stop unmute-backend
   
   # Rebuild with your fork
   cd /mnt/raid1/GitHub/unmute
   docker build -t unmute-backend:knowall .
   
   # Run your custom version
   docker run -d --name unmute-backend-knowall -p 8765:80 unmute-backend:knowall
   ```

5. **Update Nod.ie Configuration:**
   No changes needed - Nod.ie will automatically use the Unmute backend on ws://localhost:8765

## What This Achieves:
- Removes the "unmute.sh" identity 
- Adds environmental awareness for background noise
- Makes Nod.ie more patient with silence
- Clarifies it's running on a fork maintained by KnowAll AI
